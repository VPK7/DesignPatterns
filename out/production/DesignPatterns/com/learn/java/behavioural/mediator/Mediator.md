Mediator design pattern is one of the important and widely used behavioral design pattern.
Mediator enables decoupling of objects by introducing a layer in between so that the interaction between objects happen via the layer.
If the objects interact with each other directly, the system components are tightly-coupled with each other that makes higher maintainability
cost and not hard to extend. Mediator pattern focuses on providing a mediator between objects for communication and help in implementing
lose-coupling between objects.

Air traffic controller is a great example of mediator pattern where the airport control room works as a mediator for communication 
between different flights. Mediator works as a router between objects and it can have itâ€™s own logic to provide way of communication.
